# Starting Zones

So in this session we spoke a bit about the game board. We've had issues with making building placement an important part of the game, so determining the game board size and tweaking it was also done this session. Oscar suggested adding starting zones that buildings have to connect to rather than how we had it before where you could just build anything anywhere.

You can see we have 4 little squares now, each one belonging to a player. Originally we had 4 different hospitals/wards, but as we decided to just have one hospital we needed some originating soruce for placing buildings. We did do some experiments with having tiles that have doors and you have to connect doors up, but we had issues trying to actualy prototype that mechanic so we decided not to.

Overall this was a good change for the game, as it means that you now have to choose between connecting up so your staff can help other players, or focusing on just yourself which allows you to better optimise how you position your buildings so that there's no wasted space. Once a player is connected to other buildings, they can then build off of those buildings, so once all 4 players are connected the only limit to where you can place buildings is if they are bordering an existing building in the hospital.
