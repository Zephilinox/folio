# Balancing issues

So in our NHS game we have 5 rounds, each round consisting of several turns. We've been having issues balancing the game due to an issue where if you end a round early, you end up hurting yourself because you get less cards (3 per round), less actions (building/moving staff), which results in the game becoming harder as you end rounds earlier. This leads people to stretch out a round as long as possible before completing it, making all subsequent rounds so much easier.

It took us a long time to reach this conclusion, I think Tom made the actual observation. We knew the exploit was an issue which we previously tried to correct in several ways (bonus cards, money, research points, etc.). However it wasn't until we tried to balance the game properly near the end (as we kept iterating and changing mechanics trying to do so earlier would have been a wasted effort) we realised that the game was impossible to balance based on this. We did try to introduce a chase mechanic to winning/losing the game based on how you clear rounds, but it didn't really do much to help despite iterating that mechanic a few times. In the end we decided to force players to have 3 turns per round for 4 rounds (although that might change slightly still) so that we could better balance exactly how many patients players would get each round, as we could now have some expectation of how many buildings/staff players would have available on the board so clear the patient intake. For instance, round 1 you have 9 patients to cure over 3 turns, so this means 3 of the 4 players can focus on building buildings and the 4th one can do whatever he likes and still be able to win that round. How teams approach this changes how they plan to tackle future rounds, as that 4th player could put money in to research, staff, or just trade it around. Usually you don't just have a spare player doing whatever, and instead have all 4 players contributing a little and then have 1 turn each to do something extra.

In future rounds we know the players can handle the cards of the previous round, so round 2 we know they can handle 3, so we make it 8, that means an increase of 5 cards (15 patients) which means they have to somehow cure 5 patients per turn, which isn't too difficult as by round 2 you should have some doctors available.

Basically it makes the game less random and more formulaic, which has pros and cons, but ultimately it does lead to a much more balanced game that is actually playable and not entirely broken, so overall it was a success.
