Cowboys is a networked, turn-based startegy game where you control a team of 5 differnt cowboys and battle it out against another player. 

Click on units to select them and then right click on a tile to path towards it. If you right click an enemy unit, your unit will fire at them.

Once you're done with your units actions hit end turn and the next player will be able to control one of their units.
