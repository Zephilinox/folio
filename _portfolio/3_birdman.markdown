#### Birdman
A simple interactive story game based on birdman for LLP.

You play as an actor and have to make decisions about the way the story progresses.

Test out the audiences reaction during the two rehearsels, and then get your final score at the end of the opening night itself.

Use W and S and Enter to select options, ESC to open the pause menu.
